# Diabetes-Prediction-ML-SVM
This project revolves around predicting diabetes onset using Python and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. Trained the SVM algorithm, and fine-tuned the model for accurate predictions. This project serves as a platform for honing my machine learning skills and exploring the potential of predictive modeling in real-world applications.
